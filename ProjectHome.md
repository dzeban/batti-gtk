Batti is a simple battery monitor for the system tray, similar to [batterymon](http://code.google.com/p/batterymon). Unlike the latter batti uses [UPower](http://upower.freedesktop.org/), and if that is missing DeviceKit.Power, for it's power information.


### Features ###
  * one tray icon per inserted battery
  * tray icons (dis-)appear with the battery (un-)plugging
  * notification on low and critical battery status
  * suspend/hibernate menu on left-click, if allowed by PolicyKit
